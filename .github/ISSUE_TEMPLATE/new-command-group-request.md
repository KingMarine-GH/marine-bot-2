# New Group Command Suggestion

## What is the actual base slash command?

Comply with Discord's limits. <https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands#a-quick-note-on-limits>
You usually won't hit any limits though

## What commands are included?

You can either give a vauge description of each command in the command group or make seperate issues and link it back here <https://guides.github.com/features/issues/#:~:text=You%20can%20reference%20issues%20by,hashtag%20plus%20the%20issue%20number.&text=Issue%20in%20another%20repository%3F,reference%20issues%20directly%20from%20commits.>

## Any restriction of use?

Should group of commands only be allowed to be called by people with a certain role or even specific people?

## Additional Notes

Put any additional comments here if you have any
