**What is the actual slash command?**
Comply with Discord's limits. https://discord.com/developers/docs/interactions/slash-commands#a-quick-note-on-limits
You usually won't hit any limits though

**Describe the function of the slash command**
Just give a short explanation of what the result of the command will be. Ex: `/ban` will ban a user

**Any restriction of use?**
Should the command only be allowed to be called by people with a certain role or even specific people?

**Additional Notes**
Put any additional comments here if you have any
